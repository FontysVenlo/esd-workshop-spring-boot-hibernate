# Alternatives

## Java specific alternatives

The following alternatives are frameworks that are similiar by nature to java spring boot. They are both Java Frameworks that are suited for microservices.

### Micronaut

Micronaut is "a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications" (Micronaut, n.d.). It has a very small start up time using its annotation processing at compile time and using ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.(Micronaut, n.d.) This is very powerful when developing microservices as a lot of developers will have to restart microservices for testing purposes. Instead of having to wait for it to boot up Micronaut reduces this process to almost instant. However being quite new it has not as a developed Eco-System as Java Spring Boot and additionally a steeper learning curve do to its different approach than Spring when it comes to Input and Output as well as error handling.(HiQ, n.d.)


Companies that use it: Sonar Target Minecraft and Mojang

### Quarkus

[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)

Quarkus is "a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM". (Quarkus, 2024)

Similiar to Micronaut it is also the case that "GraalVM accelerates application performance while consuming fewer resources—improving application efficiency and reducing IT costs. It achieves this by compiling your Java application ahead of time into a native binary." (GraalVM, 2025) This significantely reduces start up time for quarkus aswell. Quarkus also integrates with Kubernetes very well, it calls itself "Kube-Native" which makes it really powerful when using both. It offers "increased developer productivity with tooling, pre-built integrations, application services, and more." (Quarkus, 2024) Quarkus also runs into the same issue as Quarkus as it is a new Framework the Eco-System is quite small compared to Springs. It also has a harder learning curve and is an adjustment coming from spring. (HiQ, n.d.)
