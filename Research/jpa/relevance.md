Java is used by 90% of Fortune 500 companies due to its stability, predictability, and backward compatibility (TMS Outsource, 2025). Of these, approximately 40% use Spring Boot, meaning that roughly 36% of Fortune 500 companies rely on Spring Boot for their applications (TMS Outsource, 2025).

Within Spring Boot’s ORM ecosystem, JPA and its implementations dominate, making up around 75% of usage (MoldStud, 2025a).

Hibernate leads the market with a 60% usage rate by developers working with relational databases (MoldStud, 2025b). Spring Data complements this by improving data access. Over 45% of enterprise applications utilize Spring Data, which streamlines CRUD operations and integrates seamlessly with various data sources, enhancing developer productivity (Avori, 2025)^[1].

Given the maturity and continued relevance of Java and Spring Boot, JPA remains a critical, widely-used technology for relational data management in modern enterprise applications (TIOBE, 2025; Stack Overflow, 2025).
