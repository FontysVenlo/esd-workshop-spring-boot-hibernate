Java is used by 90% of Fortune 500 companies due to its stability, predictability, and backward compatibility. Of these, approximately 40% use Spring Boot, meaning that roughly 36% of Fortune 500 companies rely on Spring Boot for their applications (Sandu, 2025).

Within Spring Boot’s ORM ecosystem, JPA and its implementations dominate, making up around 75% of usage (Crudu, 2025).

Hibernate leads the market with a 60% usage rate by developers working with relational databases. Spring Data complements this by improving data access. Over 45% of enterprise applications utilize Spring Data, which streamlines CRUD operations and integrates seamlessly with various data sources, enhancing developer productivity (Crudu, 2025).

Given the maturity and continued relevance of Java and Spring Boot, JPA remains a critical, widely-used technology for relational data management in modern enterprise applications (Crudu, 2025; Goroshko, 2025).
