## Important information

<details>

<summary>Changes to the scope</summary>

After talking to the lecturers it was approved that we are allowed to reduce our scope from initially SpringBoot + Hibernate to focus more on Spring and Jpa (the underlying interface which hibernate implements). Hibernate and (spring)Boot will still be covered, however in not as much detail as this would highly exceed what is possible to explain and document in this repository. We arrived at this conclusion after our research showed how deep Spring and its component truly is.
